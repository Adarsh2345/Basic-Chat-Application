### 3. Set up the frontend

Change the  IP address in the frontend code to point to your local server : Use your system's local IP address which can be found by typing ipconfig in Command Prompt

```bash

// App.js
const socket = io('http://192.168.X.X:3001'); // Replace with your actual IP
```
Then install Expo CLI if you havenâ€™t already:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Start the frontend:

```bash

cd client
npm install
expo start
```
Use Expo Go on your phone to scan the QR code and launch the app.

## ðŸ“± Testing on Mobile
Ensure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.

Replace localhost with your local IP address in the frontend code.

Scan the QR code using Expo Go.
